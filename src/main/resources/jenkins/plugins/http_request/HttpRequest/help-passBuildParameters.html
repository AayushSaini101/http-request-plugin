    <p>Should build parameters be passed to the URL being called?</p>
    <p>
        In Workflow, this parameter is ignored. In Workflow, if you want
        to pass build parameters as part of the URL, you append
        them to the url argument as you write the code (e.g.: <tt>String url = "url?param1=${param1}&amp;param2=${param2}"</tt>)
    </p>
</div>
